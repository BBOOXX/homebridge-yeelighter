> Yeelight support for Homebridge: https://github.com/nfarina/homebridge with particular focus on supporting the special features of ceiling lights.

> There are many plugins for Yeelight already. This one is unique (so far) in supporting the
> background light that some yeelights have and also has a diffent approach to the moonlight mode (exposed as just another range for brightness).
